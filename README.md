# Audio Neural Network Lab
### Install
Everything is containerized, so right now you just need the latest version of [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Then run,
``` shell
docker-compose up
```
and navigate to the [local jupyter server](http://localhost:42065) and the [local tensorboard](http://localhost:45175).
